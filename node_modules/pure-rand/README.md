## Getting started

**Install it in node via:**

`npm install pure-rand` or `yarn add pure-rand`

**Use it in browser by doing:**

`import * as prand from 'https://unpkg.com/pure-rand/lib/esm/pure-rand.js';`

## Usage

**Simple usage**

```javascript
import prand from 'pure-rand';

const seed = 42;
const rng = prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed);
const firstDiceValue = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng); // value in {1..6}, here: 2
const secondDiceValue = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng); // value in {1..6}, here: 4
const thirdDiceValue = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng); // value in {1..6}, here: 6
```

**Pure usage**

Pure means that the instance `rng` will never be altered in-place. It can be called again and again and it will always return the same value. But it will also return the next `rng`. Here is an example showing how the code above can be translated into its pure version:

```javascript
import prand from 'pure-rand';

const seed = 42;
const rng1 = prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed);
const [firstDiceValue, rng2] = prand.uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng1); // value in {1..6}, here: 2
const [secondDiceValue, rng3] = prand.uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng2); // value in {1..6}, here: 4
const [thirdDiceValue, rng4] = prand.uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng3); // value in {1..6}, here: 6

// You can call: prand.uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng1);
// over and over it will always give you back the same value along with a new rng (always producing the same values too).
```

**Independent simulations**

In order to produce independent simulations it can be tempting to instanciate several PRNG based on totally different seeds. While it would produce distinct set of values, the best way to ensure fully unrelated sequences is rather to use jumps. Jump just consists into moving far away from the current position in the generator (eg.: jumping in Xoroshiro 128+ will move you 2<sup>64</sup> generations away from the current one on a generator having a sequence of 2<sup>128</sup> elements).

```javascript
import prand from 'pure-rand';

const seed = 42;
const rngSimulation1 = prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed);
const rngSimulation2 = rngSimulation1.jump(); // not in-place, creates a new instance
const rngSimulation3 = rngSimulation2.jump(); // not in-place, creates a new instance

const diceSim1Value = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rngSimulation1); // value in {1..6}, here: 2
const diceSim2Value = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rngSimulation2); // value in {1..6}, here: 5
const diceSim3Value = prand.unsafeUniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rngSimulation3); // value in {1..6}, here: 6
```

**Non-uniform usage**

While not recommended as non-uniform distribution implies that one or several values from the range will be more likely than others, it might be tempting for people wanting to ma
